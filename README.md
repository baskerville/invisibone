## Origin

This scheme is based on gutterslob's [visibone alt. 2](http://dotshare.it/dots/169/), itself based on the work of [Bob Stein](http://www.visibone.com/about.html).

Underlying constraints are: [triads](http://www.tigercolor.com/color-lab/color-theory/color-harmonies.htm) and [uniform luminance](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) of the dark and bright groups.
