## Origins

This scheme is based on gutterslob's [visibone alt. 2](http://dotshare.it/dots/169/).

It was generated from *visibone alt. 2* by using [triads](http://www.tigercolor.com/color-lab/color-theory/color-harmonies.htm) and uniform luminance of the dark and bright groups.

The inspiration for the L\*a\*b\* constraint is [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).
